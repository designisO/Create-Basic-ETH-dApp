## Creating Basic Ethereum dApp

In this project I wanted to create a basic Ethereum dApp front-end, deploy a Solidity smart contract and connect them together. Metamask, Remix IDE and Ethers.js was used to achieve such. Once deployed, I was able to confirm the transaction the Ropsten.Etherscan.io (Testnet Etherscan).

## Overview

- Create a basic HTML web page
- Create a basic Solidity smart contract
- Connect the web page with the smart contracts using Ethers.js


###  Metamask

Metamask is a free Ethereum crypto wallet. Download it from Chrome extensions. Once logged in, I was able to connect it to my Remix IDE for testing of contract using Ropsten Network. In order to handle the transaction cost, I had to get test funds from a faucet. https://faucet.egorfine.com/

### Remix IDE.

Remix IDE is an IDE built by Ethereum allowing users to create EVM compatible smart contracts. This tool allowed compiling and deploying of the smart contract built.

### Ethers.js

Ethers allows the connection of the Ropsten network to occur to the dApp and make deployment happen. Ethers library aims to be great for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and it's ecosystem.
